        <p>This field manual establishes doctrine (fundamental principles) for tactical counterinsurgency (COIN)
operations at the company, battalion, and brigade level. It is based on lessons learned from historic
counterinsurgencies and current operations. This manual continues the efforts of FM 3-24, Counterinsurgency,
in combining the historic approaches to COIN with the realities of today’s operational environment (OE)—an
environment modified by a population explosion, urbanization, globalization, technology, the spread
of religious fundamentalism, resource demand, climate change and natural disasters, and proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction. This manual is generic in its geographic focus and should be used with other
doctrinal sources</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Chapter 1, Operational Environment of Counterinsurgency, defines insurgent
and counterinsurgent while using the operational variables and mission variables to describe the OE. Finally, it stresses developing a culture capability for Soldiers and leaders.</li>
			<li>Chapter 2, Foundations of Insurgency, categorizes insurgent groups by their components— elements, dynamics, and strategies and their manifestations—tactics, strengths,
and vulnerabilities.</li>
			<li>Chapter 3, Foundations of Counterinsurgency, covers the seven lines of effort, tactical considerations, clear-hold-build operations, and counterinsurgency phases.</li>
			<li>Chapter 4, Planning in Counterinsurgency, arguably the most important chapter, covers planning for tactical units during counterinsurgency operations. It also covers planning horizons and targeting.</li>
			<li>Chapter 5, Offensive Operations in Counterinsurgency, addresses offensive techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations.</li>
			<li>Chapter 6, Defensive Operations in Counterinsurgency, addresses defensive techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations.</li>
			<li>Chapter 7, Stability Operations in Counterinsurgency, addresses stability techniques used by tactical units during counterinsurgency operations.</li>
			<li>Chapter 8, Working with Host Nation Security Forces, covers the seven steps (MORTEAM) units use to train, advise, and partner with Host Nation security forces.</li>
		</ul>
        <p>The target audience is commanders, staff, and Soldiers of US Army units up to brigade level.</p>
		<p>This manual applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard (ARNG)/Army National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS), and the US Army Reserve (USAR) unless otherwise stated.</p>
		<p>The proponent for this publication is the US Army Training and Doctrine Command. The preparing agency is the US Army Infantry School.

        <header>INTRODUCTION</header>
        <p>This manual gives the US Army a common language, concept, and purpose to fight and achieve success in a
counterinsurgency. COIN is a complex subset of warfare that encompasses all military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat an insurgency at the company, battalion,
and brigade levels. To do this, the manual merges traditional approaches to COIN with the realities of the current
operational environment.</p>
        <p>The US Army thinking and doctrine on COIN tactics since the end of World War II have focused on the conduct
of counterguerrilla operations in the later stages of insurgency. The Army has seen itself as defeating guerrilla
forces—usually communist forces—rather than defeating an entire insurgency. It saw success as something it could
achieve by using the force of arms directly against guerrilla forces. This doctrine of COIN began to take shape shortly
after World War II in manuals such as FM 31-20, Operations against Guerrilla Forces (1951) and later in FM 31-15,
Operations against Irregular Forces (1961). The Army refined its counterinsurgency doctrine during Vietnam
in FM 31-22, US Counterinsurgency Force, FM 31-16, Counterguerrilla Operations (both published in 1963)
and in FM 31-23, Stability and Support Operations (1972). After Vietnam, the Army split COIN doctrine off from
conventional “high intensity” operations in FM 100-20, Military Operations in Low Intensity Conflict (1990) in which
the “light” forces owned counterinsurgency, and FM 90-8, Counterguerrilla Operations (1986), where the focus
remained on defeating the guerrilla force. This manual is the historical successor to FM 90-8. In addition, parts of FM
100-20 have been integrated into this FM, as have the Army’s concept of full-spectrum operations and all elements
of COIN operations.</p>
		<p>At its heart, a counterinsurgency is an armed struggle for the support of the population. This support can be achieved
or lost through information engagement, strong representative government, access to goods and services, fear,
or violence. This armed struggle also involves eliminating insurgents who threaten the safety and security of the
population. However, military units alone cannot defeat an insurgency. Most of the work involves discovering
and solving the population’s underlying issues, that is, the root causes of their dissatisfaction with the current
arrangement of political power. Dealing with diverse issues such as land reform, unemployment, oppressive
leadership, or ethical tensions places a premium on tactical leaders who can not only close with the enemy, but also
negotiate agreements, operate with nonmilitary agencies and other nations, restore basic services, speak the native (a
foreign) language, orchestrate political deals, and get "the word" on the street.</p>
		<p>Today’s counterinsurgent battlefield is increasingly cluttered with US, Host Nation, and other coalition forces, each
with its own strengths and limitations. In addition, multiple insurgent groups, nongovernmental organizations, armed
contractors, and a local population divided into several ethnic groups add to this clutter. A counterinsurgency
long-range plan for a tactical unit combines offensive, defensive and stability operations. To achieve the appropriate
ratio between these and accomplish unity of effort among diverse units and actors, units must build long-term plans
around the seven counterinsurgency lines of effort: establish civil security, establish civil control, support Host Nation
forces, support to governance, restore essential services, support economic and infrastructure development,
and conduct information engagement.</p>
		<p>All seven lines of effort are critical to establishing unity of effort for actions conducted by US units, Host Nation
security forces, and the Host Nation government. These actions can range from killing or capturing an insurgent cell
known to emplace IEDs, to solving unemployment in an area, to publicizing the opening of a water treatment facility.
Without unity of effort over time, the tactical unit’s long-range plan will face challenges in securing the population,
gathering the population’s support, and defeating the insurgency.</p>
		<p>Counterinsurgency is an iterative process. Tactical units can conduct a wide variety of operations. These can include
anything from a combined cordon and search operation with Host Nation security forces, to a medical operation
to inoculate a hamlet’s children against disease, to a road project to connect a village to the highway, to a loudspeaker
broadcast to inform a village about a recent council meeting. Regardless of the mission, successful tactical units learn
and adapt as they discover more about their own strengths and limitations—and the strengths and limitations of the
Host Nation government, the populace, and the insurgents. This manual furthers FM 3-24’s theory that “in COIN, the
side that learns faster and adapts more rapidly—the better learning organization—usually wins.”</p>
		<p>Each counterinsurgency is unique. Leaders must always execute good judgment, tactical patience, and innovation
to defeat an insurgency. As the US Army continues its lengthy battles against insurgency around the world, tactical
units must continue to focus on securing the support of the population, achieving unity of effort, and learning
and adapting faster than the insurgents do.</p>
